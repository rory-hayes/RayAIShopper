## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open in browser and begin the Ray shopping experience

## QR Code Integration

The app detects a `storeID` URL parameter for in-store usage:
- `?storeID=123` enables store-specific features
- Shows item locations within the store
- Provides "Find in Store" instead of checkout

This wizard provides a solid foundation for a production-ready fashion assistant experience, with clean code architecture that can be easily extended with AI capabilities and backend integration.
